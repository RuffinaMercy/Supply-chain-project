# M5 Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for forecasting retail sales demand using the M5 competition dataset and calculating inventory control parameters. The entire pipeline is built using a modern data stack: dbt, Snowflake, Snowpark, MLflow, and Streamlit.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal is to predict the next 28 days of unit sales for thousands of products sold at Walmart stores in the USA. Based on these forecasts, we then calculate essential inventory metrics like Safety Stock and Reorder Point to help optimize stock levels.

**Core Technologies Used:**
- **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake
- **Data Transformation:** dbt (Data Build Tool)
- **ML & Processing:** Snowpark for Python
- **ML Experiment Tracking:** MLflow
- **Dashboarding:** Streamlit
